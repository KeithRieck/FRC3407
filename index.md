# FRC team 3407

## Who We Are

We are the Robotics team of Mounds View High School; Team 3407: Wild Cards. Every year, we compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). Our team has to design, prototype, build, test, and perfect a robot all in the time between kickoff and compitition.

We strive to teach our students skills that will not only help our team's performance, but also to help them develop skills. Students in Robotics will learn skills in leadership, teamwork, problem-solving, and many other skills that may help them succeed in their future STEM or non-STEM endeavors. We encourage knowledge, strength, and interest in STEM.

We recuit new members during Setember, then take the fall to train. After kickoff in January, we build our robot for the current year's game. Once it's time, we take our robot to competition to show off what we've been able to make.
